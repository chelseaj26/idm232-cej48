            <p>These Italian focaccia sandwiches are layered with broccoli, three cheeses, and a savory basil, cashew, and pine nut pesto, then baked in the oven to meld all the bright, aromatic flavors. On the side, weʼre serving a refreshing salad of romaine and seasonal clementine, dressed in a creamy dressing made with fresh clementine juice.</p>

                    Place an oven rack in the center of the oven, then preheat to 475°F. Wash and dry the fresh produce. Cut off and discard the bottom 1/2 inch of the broccoli stem; cut the broccoli into small pieces, keeping the florets intact. Peel and roughly chop the garlic. Halve the focaccia. Grate the asiago cheese on the large side of a box grater. Tear the mozzarella cheese into small pieces. In a bowl, combine the tomato sauce and Italian seasoning; season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>

                    In a large pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the broccoli pieces; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes, or until slightly softened. Add the chopped garlic; cook, stirring frequently, 1 to 2 minutes, or until slightly softened and fragrant. Add 1/2 cup of water; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 4 to 5 minutes, or until the broccoli has softened and the water has cooked off. Turn off the heat.</p>

                    Line a sheet pan with foil. Place the halved focaccia on the foil, cut side up; drizzle with olive oil. Top with the seasoned tomato sauce. Top the focaccia bottom with the grated asiago cheese, half the mozzarella cheese, and the cooked broccoli. Evenly top the broccoli with the remaining mozzarella cheese and pesto (stirring before adding). Season both focaccia halves with salt and pepper. Bake, rotating the sheet pan halfway through, 11 to 13 minutes, or until lightly browned and the cheese has melted. Remove from the oven; let stand for at least 2 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board.</p>

                    While the focaccia bakes, cut off and discard the root end of the lettuce; roughly chop the leaves. Place in a large bowl. Roughly chop the peppers. Halve 1 clementine crosswise; squeeze the juice into a bowl, straining out any seeds. Peel the remaining clementine; separate into segments. To make the dressing, add the crème fraîche, mustard, and 1 tablespoon of water to the bowl of clementine juice. Slowly whisk in a drizzle of olive oil until combined; season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>
